# This one configured to start broadband application.
# Needs to be stored in...
# /lib/systemd/system/myscript.service
# and needs 644 permissions.
# To enable this to run....
# sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#  sudo systemctl enable myscript.service
# then reboot.
# Check it is running with: sudo systemctl status myscript.service
# Can also stop/start with...
# systemctl stop myscript.service
# systemctl start myscript.service
# The output from any script run here can be found by....
#  sudo journalctl -u myscript.service
#  or... sudo journalctl -u myscript.service --since=yesterday
#  Note: redirection to a file will never work! The tutorials are all wrong. There is no shell to make it work.
